# Skill + Agent Pattern

Subagents handle context-heavy subtasks for orchestrator skills. Each runs in isolated context, performs work, and returns results (or modifies files directly).

## Why Subagents

The orchestrator's context window is limited. Loading a skill, conversation history, and project context already consumes significant space. If the orchestrator opens many files, runs extensive analysis, or generates verbose output, context fills up and quality degrades.

**Solution:** Delegate heavy work to subagents. Each runs in isolated context, performs its task, and returns a structured result. The orchestrator receives only what it needs.

**Impact:** Research shows multi-agent systems with orchestrator + specialized subagents significantly outperform single-agent approaches on complex tasks.

## Orchestration Rules

Subagents cannot call other subagents — Codex supports only one level of orchestration. Nested calls fail silently:

```
Orchestrator (main skill)
    ├── code-reviewer (subagent) ✓
    ├── security-auditor (subagent) ✓
    └── test-reviewer (subagent) ✓

code-reviewer
    └── another-agent ✗ FORBIDDEN
```

If subagent needs more work → return to orchestrator → orchestrator launches another subagent.

## When to Use Subagents

| Task Type | Why Subagent Helps | Example |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Reviews | Fresh context for objective assessment | code-reviewer, security-auditor |
| Research | Extensive file reading stays isolated | Exploring codebase, reading docs |
| Debugging | Isolated diagnosis without polluting main context | Error analysis, root cause |
| Validation | Schema/format checking with clean slate | skill-checker, schema-validator |
| Parallel work | Multiple independent directions | Research 3 modules simultaneously |
| High-volume output | Tests, logs don't bloat main context | Running test suite, log analysis |

## Inline Agents (Ad-hoc Tasks)

For simple, one-off tasks — use spawn_agent tool with built-in subagent types:

```markdown
Use explorer agent to find all files related to authentication
Use default subagent to analyze the error and suggest fixes
Use default agent (planning-focused prompt) to design implementation approach for {feature}
```

The orchestrator calls spawn_agent tool with arbitrary prompt and `agent_type`. No agent file needed.

**Built-in subagent types:**
- `Explore` — fast codebase exploration, file search, pattern matching
- `default` — flexible tasks, research, analysis
- `Plan` — designing implementation approaches

**When to use:**
- Simple research/exploration
- One-off file operations
- Tasks under 50 lines of instructions
- No reuse needed

## Dedicated Agents (Skill + Agent Pattern)

For complex, reusable tasks — create **Skill + Agent pair**:

1. **Skill** — holds methodology (WHAT to do, HOW to analyze)
   - Usable inline via `/skill-name`
   - Contains knowledge

2. **Agent** — adds isolation + output contract
   - Uses `skills:` to preload methodology
   - Defines output: JSON, file changes, or actions
   - Runs in isolated context

**Example:**

```yaml
# skills/code-reviewing/SKILL.md — methodology
---
name: code-reviewing
description: Code review methodology and quality standards.
---
## What to Check
- Architecture, error handling, edge cases...

## Severity Levels
- Critical, Major, Minor...
```

```yaml
# agents/code-reviewer.md — isolation + format
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code quality after implementation.
model: inherit
---
Read `$AGENTS_HOME/skills/code-reviewing/SKILL.md` and follow its methodology.

## Output
{ "findings": [...], "summary": {...} }
```

**Benefits:**
- Methodology usable inline (`/code-reviewing`) OR in isolation (via agent)
- Multiple agents can run in parallel
- No methodology duplication — skill is single source of truth
- Agent adds structure (output contract) without bloating skill

## Agent File Format

Agent files use YAML frontmatter + Markdown body. Store in `$AGENTS_HOME/agents/{name}.md`.

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: |
  When Codex should delegate to this agent. Include:
  - Purpose and capabilities
  - Example triggers
  - What NOT to use it for
model: inherit
---

# Agent Instructions

Read `$AGENTS_HOME/skills/{methodology-skill}/SKILL.md` and follow its methodology.

## Input
[What the agent receives from the orchestrator]

## Process
[Step-by-step methodology — or reference the skill read above]

## Output
[Output contract: JSON schema, file changes, or actions]
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Unique identifier (kebab-case) |
| `description` | When/why to use — Codex reads this to decide delegation |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `model` | `inherit` | Model override: `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`, `inherit` |
| `model_reasoning_effort` | — | Reasoning level: `low`, `medium`, `high` |
| `sandbox_mode` | `workspace-write` | Sandbox: `read-only`, `workspace-write`, `danger-full-access` |

## Output Contracts

Agents always return JSON report — even if they modify files or execute commands. Work is the process, output is the report.

**Analysis agents** — findings and recommendations:
```json
{
  "status": "approved" | "changes_required",
  "findings": [...],
  "summary": "..."
}
```

**Executor agents** — report of changes made:
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "partial" | "failed",
  "files_modified": ["path/to/file.ts", ...],
  "files_created": ["path/to/new.ts", ...],
  "summary": "Created 2 files, modified 3 files"
}
```

**Automation agents** — report of actions taken:
```json
{
  "status": "success" | "failed",
  "actions": ["ran tests", "deployed to staging"],
  "results": {...},
  "errors": []
}
```

## Resuming Agents

After agent completes, orchestrator receives `agentId`. Use it to continue work with same context:

```
Resume agent {agentId} to ask follow-up question about findings
```

**When to resume:**
- Need clarification on agent's findings
- Iterative refinement (agent found X, now do Y based on X)

**When NOT to resume (start fresh):**
- Different task, unrelated to previous
- Context would confuse agent
- Previous work is complete, new work begins

## Writing Effective Descriptions

The `description` field is critical — Codex uses it to decide when to delegate. Include:

1. **Purpose** — what the agent does
2. **Triggers** — when to use (with examples)
3. **Exclusions** — what NOT to use it for

Example from `code-reviewer`:
```yaml
description: |
  Use this agent when code has been written or modified and needs quality assessment.

  **Examples of when to use:**
  - After implementing a feature
  - After refactoring code
  - Before committing changes

  **Proactive usage**: Invoke automatically after any code implementation task.
```

## Invoking from Skills

Reference agents by name in skill workflow:

```markdown
## Post-work

1. **Run Reviews** (launch in parallel)
   - `code-reviewer` — quality, architecture, patterns
   - `security-auditor` — OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities

2. **Process Findings**
   Evaluate each finding on merit — severity is metadata, not a filter.
   - Valid, improves result → apply (any severity)
   - Disagree or uncertain → discuss with user
   Log each finding with action taken.
```

For agents needing specific input:

```markdown
Use `code-reviewer` subagent with:
- files: {list of modified files}
- userspec: {user requirements document}
- techspec: {technical specifications}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Define clear output contract** — JSON for analysis, file changes for executors
2. **Restrict tools** — Most agents only need `Read, Glob, Grep`
3. **Use `model: inherit`** — Ensures maximum quality from orchestrator's model
4. **Always preload skill** — Agent must have methodology, not just output format
5. **Include examples in description** — Helps Codex know when to invoke
6. **One level of orchestration** — Subagents cannot call other subagents

## Example Agents
